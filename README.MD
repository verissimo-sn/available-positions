# First Go project - Available Positions CRUD

## Description
 - This repo is a first rest api with GO. My goal was to know a little about Go and test some native methods of the language.
 - This project doesn't have validation or treatment of data received in the endpoints, it's really just a simple crud to get to know a little of the language
 - Used the following methods - GET, POST, PUT, PATH and DELETE

## Techs and Libs
 - [Gin(Http Client)](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin)
 - [Gorm(ORM)](https://github.com/go-gorm/gorm)
 - [Sqlite(Database)](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html)

## How to show a project and run in local machine
 - Clone the repository
 - Install [GO](https://go.dev/dl/)
 - Run script ```go run main.go```
 - The api runs on port `8080`
